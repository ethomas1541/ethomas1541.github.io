                <p>
                    I am currently studying for a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at the University of Oregon,
                    and serving as an undergraduate learning assistant for CS314 Computer Organization, a class concerning
                    assembly code, memory architecture and general low-level computing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently very interested in an entry-level software engineering position, and believe myself to be
                    not only well-qualified, but passionate and dedicated to the quality of my work.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Python's one of the languages I've been using longest. I began experimenting with it in junior
                        high, and have since used it for numerous applications, including making Discord bots, webservers,
                        proxy servers and even digital art. While I don't prefer object-oriented programming, I consider
                        myself very proficient in it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I most commonly employ it in creating Flask webservers. I have also done work with database management, especially with MongoDB.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class = "skill" id = "c_skill">
                    <img src="img/c.png" alt="">
                    <h2>C</h2>
                </li>
                <li class = "skilldesc" id = "c_desc">
                    <p>
                        C is a language I learned more recently, but may be the language I most prefer using. I consider
                        myself highly proficient with the GCC compiler and GNU utility suite; especially the Valgrind
                        memory checker.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, I recently learned (entirely non-academically) how to successfully use and deploy
                        the Python C API, combining two of my strongest skills. I will soon finish a project that illustrates
                        this and push it to one of my GitHub repositories.

                <li class = "skill" id = "cpp_skill">
                    <img src="img/cpp.png" alt="">
                    <h2>C++</h2>
                </li>
                <li class = "skilldesc" id = "cpp_desc">
                    <p>
                        I have not used C++ as much, but as someone who has extensively used the C language I am confident
                        in my skills with it. Operator overloading is perhaps my favorite feature.
                    </p>

                <li class = "skill" id = "html_skill">
                    <img src="img/html.png" alt="">
                    <h2>HTML</h2>
                </li>
                <li class = "skilldesc" id = "html_desc">
                    <p>
                        Needless to say, I am versed in HTML. I am also fluent in the templating engine Jinja, which
                        I have used to drastically increase my efficiency in academic projects.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class = "skill" id = "css_skill">
                    <img src="img/css.png" alt="">
                    <h2>CSS</h2>
                </li>
                <li class = "skilldesc" id = "css_desc">
                    <p>
                        I'm also versed in CSS, the other fundamental web development language. While I don't prefer
                        my work being frontend-oriented, I can certainly use CSS very well in a pinch. 
                    </p>

                <li class = "skill" id = "js_skill">

                    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                </li>
                <li class = "skilldesc" id = "js_desc">
                    <p>
                        As someone who more prefers functional or object-oriented programming over markdown languages
                        and the like, I very much enjoy using JavaScript to make interactive, dynamic webpages.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class = "skill" id = "jq_skill">
                    <img src="img/jquery.gif" alt="">
                    <h2>JQuery</h2>
                </li>
                <li class = "skilldesc" id = "jq_desc">
                    <p>
                        Ahh... pages that update without refreshing!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I recently picked up JQuery and have very much enjoyed using it for its intended purpose:
                        Server queries!
                    </p>
